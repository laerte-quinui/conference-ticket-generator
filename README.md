## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with types
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool
- [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev/) - Library of animated components

### What I learned

Usually I just avoid designing and devolping backgrounds full of textures, images and particles, but this one was really fun! Get out of my confort-zone really helped me to be more creative and increment the background even more with the dot grid animation.

I am full of new ideas and I'm really excited to develop more lifeful backgrounds!
